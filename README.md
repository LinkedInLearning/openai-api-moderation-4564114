_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository provides basic examples of how to use the Moderation feature of the OpenAI API in Python.

There are three examples: `basic.py`, `conditional.py`, and `mod-assistant.py`. Each example is stand-alone and runs in terminal.

To use these exercise files you need an OpenAI API key. You get that key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

## Running the examples in GitHub Codespaces
1. Click the "Code" button and select "Codespaces."
2. Create a new Codespace or open one you've already created.
3. Create a new file named `.env` in the root folder.
4. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=` followed by your OpenAI API key to `.env`
5. Note `.env` is not tracked by GitHub so the file will only exist in this Codespace.
6. To run the Python example in terminal, use the `python [filename].py` command.

## Running `mod-assistant.py`
To run `mod-assistant.py` you must first create an Assistant and add its ID into the file. You can create an assistant at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com). 

For further info on OpenAI Assistants check out our dedicated course on the subject.
